  # United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Research–Statistics/NEISS‐Injury‐Data/. Accessed August 16, 2020. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was accessed from the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and used for the collection of data. This resource has proven invaluable in myriad prior analyses evaluating nationwide trends occurring in emergency medicine.4-7 Briefly, this database collects data from 100 participating hospital EDs, which is used to derive a stratified probability sample of visits to the approximately 5,000 EDs nationwide that have at least six beds and are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.8-10 From these figures, the NEISS creates annual estimates of each type of injury.9 This resource allows one to search for injuries organized by several general diagnoses, specific consumer products, and patient demographics. Additionally, a one‐ to two‐phrase narrative that describes other aspects of the patient visit is included for many cases.

## Results
Over the 10‐year period from 2010 to 2020, there were an estimated `r formatC(nationalestimate, format = "d", big.mark=",")` ED visits for retained foreign body, and `r formatC(femaleforeignbodyfordecade, format = "d", big.mark = ",")` (`r percentagefemalepelvicforeignbody`%) ED visits were related to female pelvic injuries as estimated using our sample size of `r nrow(all_pelvic_foreign_bodies_originally_labia)` patients. The typical patient with a retained bladder, rectal, or vaginal foreign body was a `r median(df$Age)`(IQR: `r median(df$Age, na.rm=TRUE)-IQR(df$Age, na.rm=TRUE)` - `r IQR(df$Age, na.rm=TRUE)+median(df$Age, na.rm=TRUE)`)) year-old `r names(which.max(table(df$Race)))`female who stated that they were not using drugs or alcohol during the placement of the foreign body.  The most common foreign body of the `r english::as.english(nlevels(df$products_description1))` types of foreign body found in the vagina and rectum was `r tolower(names(which.max(table(df$products_description1))))`, followed by `r tolower(names(summary(as.factor(df$products_description1))))[[2]]` and `r tolower(names(summary(as.factor(df$products_description1))))[[3]]`. Many of the vibrators were lost during sexual activity.  Jewelry mainly consisted of infected vaginal piercings that were removed for abscess drainage.  Drugs were commonly confiscated from the vagina following an arrest. The caps of writing utensils, perfume, hairspray, enema instruments, and toothpaste were parts that became foreign bodies.  Most injuries presented to the ED on a `r names(which.max(table(df$Treatment_Date_wday)))` during the `r tolower(names(which.max(table(df$Treatment_Date_month))))` months, and approximately `r round(tab4[2], 1)`% of foreign body cases presented on a federal holiday.  

Of the `r nrow(all_pelvic_foreign_bodies_originally_labia)` visits for foreign body in the female pelvis that were analyzed, 
(`r round(tab1[[4]],1)`%) visits involved patients who were admitted to the hospital; `r round(tab1[[3]],1)`% left the ED against medical advice; and `r round(tab1[[2]],1)`% were held for observation. Overall (Fig. 1) incidence of injury and anatomic site‐specific (Fig. 2) incidence of injury fluctuated during the time period studied. Upon analysis of foreign body by anatomic site, a majority of visits (`r round(tab2[[3]],1)`%) was due to injuries to the `r names(which.max(table(df$Anatomy_injured)))` The `r names(which.min(table(df$Anatomy_injured)))` was the least common sites of injury (Fig. 3).  The vast majority of primary diagnoses in the nose and ear were “foreign bodies” (97.1% and 93.0%, respectively)— significantly higher proportions than the incidence of foreign bodies in the other anatomic sites assessed in our analysis (P values both <0.0005) (Fig. 3). Diagnoses did not differ by where the injury occurred; for example, `r round(tab3[[2]], 1)`% of vaginal injuries occurred at `r tolower(names(which.max(table(df$Locale_Description))))` (Fig. 3).
